# Financial-Planning

## There are two financial analysis tools created in this project:

* A financial planner for emergencies. Users can utilize this tool to visualize their current savings as well as determining if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

* A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of a retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
